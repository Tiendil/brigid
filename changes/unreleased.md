- [gh-76](https://github.com/Tiendil/brigid/issues/76) — Posts can now be grouped in series. See details below.

### Series

- Added `series` attribute to the page metadata. It should contain a tag by which posts will be grouped. That tag also should be in the page's list of tags.
- Added block `brigid-series` to display a list of posts in a series.
- A list with links to the first, previous, and next posts in the series is displayed at the bottom of the post.
