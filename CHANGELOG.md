## 0.12.0 on 2024-12-01

- [gh-110](https://github.com/Tiendil/brigid/issues/110) — Replace `<a>` with `<button>` for tag filter links. This should prevent not-so-smart bots from following tag urls and trying to recursively index all possible combinations of tags.

- [gh-104](https://github.com/Tiendil/brigid/issues/104) — Paginated pages, like `/<language>/tags/3` excluded from `sitemap.xml`.

## 0.10.1 on 2024-11-04

## 0.10.0 on 2024-11-04

- [gh-76](https://github.com/Tiendil/brigid/issues/76) — Posts can now be grouped in series. See details below.

### Series

- Added `series` attribute to the page metadata. It should contain a tag by which posts will be grouped. That tag also should be in the page's list of tags.
- Added block `brigid-series` to display a list of posts in a series.
- A list with links to the first, previous, and next posts in the series is displayed at the bottom of the post.
